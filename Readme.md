Assuming that current directory "pwd" is "commonCSV":
* Compile Java code using `javac -cp [CLASS/JAR PATH] com/jcg/*.java`
* Run the Java code using `java -cp [Add all libs using the : to separate each path] com.jcg.CsvWriteReadTest`
* Check the result and the generated CSV file in your home directory
